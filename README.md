# Sky Dolly
Sky Dolly - The black sheep for your flight recordings.

## About
Sky Dolly connects to a running Flight Simulator 2020 instance and records various simulation variables, for replay.

![Sky Dolly v0.2.0](./img/SkyDolly-v0.2.0.png)

The connection is made via SimConnect, a standard API introduced with Flight Simulator X to connect with the flight simulator. So while I cannot test this myself SkyDolly theoretically also works with flight simulators other than Flight Simulator 2020.

## Basic Features
* Record
* Pause / Resume
* Play
* Variable sample rates (for both recording and playback)
* Adjustable replay speed ("slow motion", "timelapse")
